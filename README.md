# Portfolio
This is Trevor Glascock's Prototype portfolio. It is a very early WIP, before being redesigned to be project-facing and mobile-first.

## Current State
Early React App currently in development


### **`Todo:`**
- Redesign the app in React to allow for front-end routing, and highly modular components for easy maintanence.
- Follow Mobile-First Design principals.
- Ensure the Portfolio is responsive on all user devices.
- Ensure that the Portfolio displays my most current and proud displays of work.
- Possibly add additional flair and styling to make the portfolio appear more robust
